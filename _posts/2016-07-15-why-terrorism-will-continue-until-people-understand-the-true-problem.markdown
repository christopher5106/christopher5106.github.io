It is my first article about management. I've been working for one year in a big corporation and I think it's now time to describe the tools that are being used by the managers of our big corporations and countries. I know some of you will say something about this opinion, but this still does not prevent me from writing it and giving it to my 130 000 monthly readers.

Terrorism is becoming a very common thing. For people like me, my friends, we still see an opportunity that people will discover the real reason behind this new phenomenon.

The world has changed. Some people say it is sick. Some people say it has cancer. But it is not being ill when we know the reason and we just have to change : for example if you drink 1 liter of water per hour, and you know it's going to be too much, but you still continue to drink 1 liter of water per hour, then, even if water is good for your health, at that rate you will certainly create your sickness, but it is not a true disease, it is a disease you created.

Today's world is like that. This world is absolutely not questioned. Having such an attitude would be considered usually as being a bugger, an idiot... but the main problem is that this attitude is being held by the managers of our corporations and countries. So it is difficult to say it : they have the real power to be right.

Today's world has become a haven for manipulation technics, political technics, which are so invisible that the only expression of the problem relies in unspeakable phenomenoms : that is, terrorism.

The true intention of our managers is **power**, and real power means that everybody else is a slave. These managers are simply ill-intended.

So, how come we arrived in such a situation ?

The situation has been the result of heavy use of predicting capabilities. For example, it is not a surprise that the winner of the US presidential election, Obama, is the one who made a heavy use of data science to understand the reaction of people and cleverly counter their intent... in order to be elected.

But in reality, that simply means that the president has not a real political program, and his success relies in its capacity to manipulate the people. So, in a certain sense, it is what we usually name as **bullshit**. Bullshit is the sense of their real program. And bullshit means : **a loss of link with reality**.

So, mediocrity has become the true skill of the managers of our countries and big corporations. No other skill. No skill in technical analysis (that would be difficult and not necessary, left to experts). But no skill in management, because I truly believe that management is still a positive skill, **management is how we help other people succeed**. No skill in communication. But skills in politics and pyschological manipulation.

Let's just take a closer look at how this can really happen. Any human being is simply living in an environment with which she is in interaction and to which she may react in response. In particular, any human being has to make a lot of decisions every day, and many of them are unconscious. And when a decision is made, then, there is either an "acceptation", or a "rejection". There is a choice.

Now, put you at the place of Obama, the current US president, or François Hollande, the current French president. Your role is to fully use this understanding of the human beings to create an adhesion to your power. Ok, so, how do we do then ?

It is much easier than you think.

Since we have a natural tendency to accept or reject things, in the natural process of our lives, then you just have to create the causes (of rejection) and observe the effects (the rejection, the conflict). A cause produces the effect. But the effect is what people see. Terrorism is one effect. And people will judge the effect, not the causes. So you're safe as a president. And the effect will put your people into a movement in your favor (untill the people realizes it is completely manipulated) : they will reject the terrorist, accept the power.

So how do we build the cause to create an effect, if this is the root of all the story ?

There is not much to do. The first reason is because everybody knows that you have absolutely no skill at all, which will make most common people sick. This might be not sufficient to your point of view. Yes, you can go further and combine the no-skill-capability with much more violent technics

- a total absence of work and progress, this means you never solve any real problem

- some very well hidden ill-intented actions towards your targets. For example, during the Obama administration, there has been even more killings among ISIS than during the Irak war. This kind of destructive actions is very important to create the disease.

Once the mecanism of reciprocity has begun (return of violence), then, the common practice is

- leave your opponents the time of their reaction (lot's of casualties) and hide some details to leave your opponents more space for further steps in reaction (example of hidden details by the [French autorities](http://lesobservateurs.ch/2016/07/14/bataclan-testicules-coupees-mises-bouche-decapitations-proteger-musulmans-gouvernement-a-censure-tortures-infligees-aux-victimes/?utm_source=twitterfeed&utm_medium=twitter))

- make ad hominem judgements about your opponents : **describe yourself as "positive thinker" and all other actions around you as negative**. It is not really being positive to decribe negative people, but in fact, when you are the leader, it is possible, because of the power : it keeps your opponents at a good distance in the morality spectrum. Ad hominem is great, because it has still no link with reality and effective progress.

The real questions, such as access to health services, access to education, freedom of speech, equal opportunity, reduction of poverty, freedom of entreprenorship, redistribution of wealth, ... all these which are certainly the aspiration of all the people on earth, are not answered.

**Terrorism remains. And terrorism is great for our leaders, because no real action can be taken against terrorism, anybody can be a terrorist... and "no action" is also the objective of the managers of our countries and big corporations : doing nothing, and keeping the power... until we understand we have to get rid of them.**

Still sorry for the victims.
